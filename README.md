# Handwritten-linear-equation-solver-using-CNN-
The application will be able to predict and solve handwritten mathematical equations from the given image. The system is capable of solving expression involving arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) and solve linear equations upto 3 unknown variables..

Key AI concepts used include OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks). OCR is used to preprocess the image and segment characters, while CNN is used to predict the characters.
